## How To Run The Project
1. First of all clone the repository in your system and move to the root folder, then you have to run the backend server by writing the command "npm run server", then to run the frontend write the command "npm start".
2. In the home page  you can see the navbar, footer and the body of homepage, Navbar is Provided with many routes and links and it also has a cart link that is a protected route, so without logging in user cannot open that cart page.
3. Then after checking cart link user will be redirected to the login page because of protected route and then he has to login in order to see the cart page.
4. User can manually signup and login as there is a link provided for login and signup.
5. In the homepage there are many pizzas listed or  user can filter the pizzas on the basis of name and the category, and then he can add the pizzas in the cart.
6. In checkout page, user has to fill all the contact details and there he can set the promocode also. If a person enters "pizza30" he gets 30% discount.
7. So after that user can proceed to payment page where he can enter the otp which is already set to "1234". Then atlast he sees the thanks page.

## End Notes ðŸ§¾
In this project I tried to the best of my ability to replicate all the functionality and also nearly complete UI of the site. This was a great learning curve as initially it seemed imposible to acheive the objective but with time as I kept on learning new tools and technique during construct week I finally tasted the success in completing the project.
